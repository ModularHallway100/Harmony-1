# AI Artist Persona Generator Feature

This document describes the AI Artist Persona Generator feature implemented for the Harmony project.

## Overview

The AI Artist Persona Generator allows users to create, customize, and manage AI-powered artist personas with unique identities, generated images, and associated music. The feature integrates with AI services to generate compelling artist profiles and visuals.

## Features

### 1. Artist Creation Form
- Comprehensive form for generating AI artist personas
- Fields for: name, genre, bio, personality traits, visual style
- Real-time preview of generated artist profiles
- Form validation and error handling

### 2. AI Integration
- Google Gemini integration for generating artist bios and descriptions
- Nano Banana/Seedance API integration for AI image generation
- Prompt optimization for better AI-generated results
- Fallback options and error handling for AI services

### 3. Artist Profile Management
- Artist profile pages with display of generated content
- Artist editing capabilities
- Image upload and management for profile pictures
- Gallery of generated artist images

### 4. Database Integration
- Stores artist data in both PostgreSQL (structured data) and MongoDB (flexible data)
- Implements proper relationships between users and their AI artists
- Caching for frequently accessed artist data
- Proper indexing for artist searches

### 5. User Interface
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Loading states and progress indicators for AI generation
- Proper error messages and user feedback

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- `CreateArtistPage.tsx` - Enhanced artist creation form
- `ArtistProfilePage.tsx` - Artist profile display and management
- `ArtistGallery.tsx` - Gallery component for artist images
- `useAIArtistStore.ts` - Zustand store for artist data management

### Backend Services
- `ai-bio-service.js` - Google Gemini integration for bio generation
- `ai-image-service.js` - Nano Banana/Seedance API integration for image generation
- `ai-artist-cache-service.js` - Redis caching service for performance optimization
- `database-utils.js` - Database operations helper functions

### Database Schema
#### PostgreSQL Tables
- `artists` - Main artist information
- `ai_artist_details` - AI-specific artist data
- `ai_artist_images` - Generated artist images
- `ai_generation_history` - Track AI generation requests

#### MongoDB Collections
- `aiArtists` - Enhanced AI artist data with flexible schema

## API Endpoints

### Artist Management
- `GET /api/artists` - Get all artists for the current user
- `GET /api/artists/:id` - Get a specific artist
- `POST /api/artists` - Create a new artist
- `PUT /api/artists/:id` - Update an artist
- `DELETE /api/artists/:id` - Delete an artist

### Image Management
- `POST /api/artists/:id/image` - Upload artist image

### Performance Metrics
- `POST /api/artists/:id/performance` - Update artist performance metrics

## AI Services Integration

### Google Gemini Bio Generation
- Generates compelling artist bios based on user input
- Supports bio refinement and optimization
- Handles different genres and styles

### Nano Banana/Seedance Image Generation
- Creates unique artist profile images
- Supports various artistic styles and themes
- Includes prompt optimization for better results

## Caching Strategy

### Redis Caching
- Caches frequently accessed artist data
- Implements cache invalidation on data updates
- Supports cache warming for popular content

### Cache Keys
- `ai-artist:{artistId}` - Individual artist data
- `ai-artists:{userId}` - User's artists list
- `ai-artists:popular` - Popular AI artists
- `ai-artist:images:{artistId}` - Artist images
- `ai-generation:history:{userId}` - Generation history

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Cache service testing
- Error handling validation

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run AI artist specific tests
npm test -- --grep "AI Artist"

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Proper relationships between tables
- Efficient querying strategies

### Caching Strategy
- Multi-level caching (Redis + in-memory)
- Cache invalidation on data changes
- Cache warming for popular content

### AI Service Optimization
- Request batching for image generation
- Prompt optimization for better results
- Fallback mechanisms for service failures

## Security

### Authentication
- Clerk integration for user authentication
- Proper authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Protection
- Secure storage of AI-generated content
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive data
- Rate limiting for AI service calls

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key
- `NANO_BANANA_API_KEY` - Nano Banana API key
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection URL
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection URL
- `MONGODB_URL` - MongoDB connection URL

### Database Setup
1. Run the migration script to create AI artist tables
```bash
psql -d harmony -f database/migrations/001_add_ai_artist_tables.sql
```

2. Ensure proper permissions are set up for the new tables

### Redis Setup
1. Configure Redis connection
2. Enable persistence if needed
3. Set up proper memory limits

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- AI-powered music generation for artists
- Advanced personality trait customization
- Multi-language support
- Social features for AI artists

### Performance Improvements
- Asynchronous AI service calls
- Request queuing for high load
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database sharding for scale

### AI Enhancements
- More sophisticated personality modeling
- Style transfer for images
- Voice synthesis for artist personas
- Interactive AI conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AI Service Failures**
