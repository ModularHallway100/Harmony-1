### Environment Variables

The application uses Cloudflare Workers for its backend and requires API keys for AI functionality. For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file in the root directory.

1.  Copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp wrangler.jsonc .dev.vars.example # (This is a placeholder, you'll need to create the .dev.vars file manually)
    ```

2.  Create and populate `.dev.vars`:
    ```
    CF_AI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_ID/openai"
    CF_AI_API_KEY="your-cloudflare-api-key"
    ```

> **Important Note on AI Functionality**
>
> This project is configured to use AI models through Cloudflare's AI Gateway. To make the AI features fully functional, you must provide your own `CF_AI_BASE_URL` and `CF_AI_API_KEY`. Due to security constraints, API keys cannot be stored in the repository. You will need to set these up yourself after cloning the project.

## üíª Development

To start the local development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the Vite development server (typically on `http://localhost:3000`) and the local `workerd` server. The Vite server is configured to proxy API requests (`/api/*`) to the worker, enabling a seamless development experience.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is designed for easy deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    ```bash
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the application:**
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```

This command will build the frontend application and deploy it along with the worker to your Cloudflare account.

You will need to configure your secrets (`CF_AI_API_KEY`) in your Cloudflare dashboard under **Workers & Pages > Your Project > Settings > Environment variables**.

Alternatively, deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click:
